*Estimated Time:* 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a Custom Trigger
* Add disposition Rule on Non-Disclosure Agreement Record Folder
* Create User and add record reviewer roles
* Add the User in WebLogic

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
* You have completed:
  * Lab: Prepare Setup (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
  * Lab: Environment Setup
  * Lab: Initialize Environment
  * Lab: Event-based Disposition Rule on MOU Records (Task 1 is mandatory)

## Task 1: Create Custom Trigger

A global trigger is a type of custom trigger which happens at a time defined by an administrator. Global triggers have an activation date. The activation date can be a past, present, or future date. A user can create a trigger and delay the activation of a trigger for an indefinite amount of time until the activation is required. In essence, this is a dormant trigger, which does not contain an activation date.

A user can create a trigger that activates immediately, activate a trigger on a certain date and time, or delay the activation of a trigger for an indefinite amount of time until the activation is required.

1. Choose **Records** then **Configure** from the Top menu. Choose **Retention** then **Triggers** from the Page menu. The Configure Triggers Page opens.

   ![Select the option shown in this image to create custom triggers](./images/create-trigger.png "Create Trigger")

2. Select the type of trigger to create (Global, Custom Direct, or Indirect).Select **Global Trigger**. Choose **Add**.
![This image shows the Global Trigger Page.](./images/add-global-trigger.png "Global Trigger Page")
3. The Create or Edit Trigger Type Page opens. Enter an Activation Date (If not entered it is considered a dormant trigger, which can be activated later).

   ![This image shows the Global Trigger Create Page. Fill in the details as shown here.](./images/globaltrigger-creation-form.png "Global Trigger Create Page")

4. As shown in the image above, enter the **Global Trigger Name** as *Year End* and the **Activation Date**. Once done click on **Create**. Click **Ok**.

## Task 2: Add disposition Rule to Non-Disclosure Agreement Record Folder

  1. Click on **Legal Documents** under **Browse Content**. In the Retention Category Page, Click on **Edit Disposition** for the Legal Documents Category.

     ![This image shows to select the Edit Disposition option to add the disposition rule.](./images/edit-disposition.png "Edit Disposition Rule")

  2. Click on **Add** to add another disposition rule. From the **After** list, select the custom trigger *Year End* from the list and for the **Wait for** field select **Month** and give the integer value as *1*. In the **Do** list, select *Expire* and for the **Notification Reviewer** field, select *user used for login to wcc* for reviewing the record before disposition to act.
     ![This image shows the disposition rule create page and fill in the details as shown in this image.](./images/disposition-rule-creation-form.png "Disposition Rule Create Page")

### Sync Users with WCC

This section applies only if the instance is integrated with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console. Users will not appear in WCC unless they have logged into WCC at least once. To address this, we need to synchronize users and roles with WCC.

1. Login to WebCenter Content server as user with Administrator Privilege.  
 ![This image shows the WCC Instance Component Manager Page](./images/webcenter-post-login.png "WCC Component Manager Page")
2. In the same browser tab or new tab run following API from browser URL:

* **IDCS User Sync: Open below URL in your browser tab and wait for message "Users sync has been run"

```Text
<copy>https://localhost:16200/cs/idcplg?IdcService=SYNC_USERS</copy>
```

 > Note : Replace `"https://localhost"` with your **hosturl** ( eg: `"http://wcc-livelab.livelabs.oraclevcn.com"` or `"https://192.0.0.0"`)

</if>

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.

## Appendix 1: Sign in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console

If your WebCenter Content is configured with IDCS, follow the steps below to sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console. Ignore if instance is configured with Weblogic Credential Store.

  1. Go to <http://cloud.oracle.com>.

  2. Enter your cloud account name and click Next.

  3. Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console:

      * If your cloud account uses identity domains, sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console as a user configured in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM).
        * Select the default domain.

      * If your cloud account does not use identity domains, sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console as a user federated through Oracle Identity Cloud Service.
        * Under Single Sign-On (SSO) options, note the identity provider selected in the Identity Provider field and click Continue.

  4. Enter the user name and password provided in the welcome email, and click Sign In. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console is shown.
