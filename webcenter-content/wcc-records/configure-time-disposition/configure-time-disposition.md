## Task 1: Create Custom Trigger

Global trigger is a type of custom trigger which happens at a time defined by an administrator. Global triggers have an activation date. The activation date can be a past, present, or future date. A user can create a trigger and delay the activation of a trigger for an indefinite amount of time until activation is required. In essence this is a dormant trigger, which does not contain an activation date.

A user can create a trigger that activates immediately, activate a trigger on a certain date and time, or delay the activation of a trigger for an indefinite amount of time until activation is required.

1. Choose Records then Configure from the Top menu. Choose Retention then Triggers from the Page menu. The Configure Triggers Page opens.

   ![Select the option shown in this image to create custom triggers](./images/create-trigger.png "Create Trigger")

2. Select the type of trigger to create (Global, Custom Direct, or Indirect). Choose Add. The Create or Edit Trigger Type Page opens. Enter an Activation Date (If not entered it is considered a dormant trigger, which can be activated later).
