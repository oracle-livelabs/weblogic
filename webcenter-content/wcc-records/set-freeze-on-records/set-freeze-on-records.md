# Legal Hold on Records

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the freeze functionality of WebCenter Records Management that inhibits the record to undergo disposition processing. Freeze functionality is generally used for legal documents that need to be retained and any critical document which should not be accidentally purged from the system.

*Estimated Time:* 15 minutes
