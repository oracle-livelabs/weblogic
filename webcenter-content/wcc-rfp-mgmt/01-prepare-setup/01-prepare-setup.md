# Prepare Setup

## Introduction

This lab will show you how to download the Oracle Resource Manager (ORM) stack zip file needed to setup the resource needed to run this workshop. This workshop requires a compute instance and a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN).

**Estimated Lab Time**: *30 minutes*

### Objectives

- Download WCC RFP Resources
- Prepare tenancy for setting up WCC Marketplace instance, including VCN and Database

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- An Oracle Paid Cloud account - *to create DB System and WCC Marketplace instance*
- SSH Keys (optional)

## Task 1: Download WCC RFP Resources zip file

  1. Click on the link below to download the WCC RFP Resources zip file , which you will need to successfully complete this Workshop:
    * File : [wcc\_rfp\_resources.zip](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/wHKALsCO-tCCxBk1hp4NY2UWlIrW9w33V0iWHzIF7cWZQT6ywjcahubybnuMHgLO/n/idk8vszypyjt/b/wcc_rfpmgmt_livelab/o/wcc_rfp_resources.zip)

  2. Save in your downloads folder and Un-Compress/Unzip.

    > **Note** : *The files present under this will be referred and used in the workshop lab*

## Task 2: Prepare Your OCI Tenancy

  This task helps you to prepare your OCI tenancy for provisioning WebCenter Content Marketplace Stack

  Before you begin, you would need to complete the following tasks and prerequisites.

### **System Requirements**

  You require access to the following services to use Oracle WebCenter Content on OCI:

    * Identity and Access Management (IAM)

    * Compute, Network, Block Storage, Block Volume

    * Vault, Key, Secret

    * Resource Manager

    * Database

    * Load Balancer

    * Tagging

  Make sure you have the following minimum limits for the services in your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy, and if necessary, request for an increase of a service limit.

  ![Service Limits ](images/prepare_oci_task2_service_limits.png "Service Limits")

  See [Service Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm) in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure documentation.

### **2.1 Sign in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console**

Complete the following steps to sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console.

  1. Go to <http://cloud.oracle.com>.

  2. Enter your cloud account name and click Next.

  3. Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console:

      - If your cloud account uses identity domains, sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console as a user configured in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM).
        - Select the default domain.

      - If your cloud account does not use identity domains, sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console as a user federated through Oracle Identity Cloud Service.
        - Under Single Sign-On (SSO) options, note the identity provider selected in the Identity Provider field and click Continue.

  4. Enter the user name and password provided in the welcome email, and click Sign In. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console is shown.

### **2.2 Generate SSH key pair**

  See [generate_ssh_key](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/compute-iaas/generating_ssh_key/generate_ssh_key.html) for generating an SSH key pair.

  This SSH key pair will be used for connecting to Bastion and Compute instances after stack execution.

  > Note: This will be used to create DB and WebCenter Content nodes.

### **2.3 Create a Compartment**

  If your tenancy does not already include a compartment for your Oracle WebCenter Content on Marketplace instances, you can create a new one.

  Note: To create a compartment, your administrator must first add the following policy for your group: allow group groupName to manage compartments in tenancy

  To create a compartment in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure:

  1. Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console [ *Using the previous steps mentioned in Task 2.1 above* ]

  2. Open the navigation menu and click **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity**, click **Compartments**. A list of the existing compartments in your tenancy is displayed.

  3. Click **Create Compartment**.

  4. Enter the following:
    - **Name**: Specify a name. For example,
          ```text
              <copy>wcc</copy>
          ```
    *Restrictions for compartment names are: Maximum 100 characters, including letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores. The name must be unique across all the compartments in your tenancy.*
    - **Description**: A friendly description.
          ```text
            <copy>Compartment used for WCC Marketplace stack</copy>
          ```
  5. Click **Create Compartment**.

## Task 3: Create Database

  *Youâ€™d need a new DB system only if you want to provision a new database. Otherwise, you can use an existing database too.*

    > Note: Currently, only the Oracle Base Database Service is supported. Support for other versions will be provided in upcoming releases

  Complete the following to create a new DB system:

- **Create VCN**
