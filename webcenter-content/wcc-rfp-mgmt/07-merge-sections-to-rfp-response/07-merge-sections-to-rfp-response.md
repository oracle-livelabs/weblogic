# Merge Section Documents to create RFP Response

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps for Selecting the Completed Section Documents and creating the Response Document, by merging all the selected Section documents, in the same order it was selected. This takes you through the Library Page, where you can find all the Completed Section Documents, Uploaded RFP Documents and also Merged Response documents.

This Page also lists all these documents in card layout and also provides various filter options to narrow-down the search and selection.
